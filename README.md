## OVERVIEW
  As we all know gaming industry is growing day by day. As a result of this growth the concept of gaming centers has been popular lately. In a gaming center they normally use coins to play the games. The procedure is when a customer comes to the gaming center they have to buy coins from the cashier in order to use those as a paying method to the gaming machine. Once they put enough number of coins into the machine they are allowed to play the game.

## Problem
  The problems of this approach are the coins are simply hard to carry around the gaming center when the customer has large number of coins and also they have good chance to loose a coin or two. When we consider the gaming center's point of view they have to collect coins every day at each machines and count it and keep the record.

## Our Solution
  As a solution for above problems we came up with a solution which completely replace coins system with a RFID and NFC technology. In our solution, when the customer arrives at the cashier and pay money they will be issued a RFID card or if they have NFC supported mobile device they can use our mobile app instead of coins. To play the game what they have to do is simply tap the RFID card or the mobile device into the reading area which is in the gaming machine. After the customer done playing he can go to the cashier and return the card. If there is any balance the cashier will return the balance.
